This program was part of a chapter test focused on Classes.  

The problem was to create a Winform using two classes with require methods
to calculate the area of the room and cost for carpeting.

Error Checking was added to ensure that no field was left blank and all
numeric fields were postive numbers.

Employed two arrays in parrallel to handle Error Code and Error Messages.
